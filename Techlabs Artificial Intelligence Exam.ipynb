A good answer shall just contain a sensible model and the testing accuracy."

The ANN model results range from 0.3 to 0.85/0.9, and trying to refine them and further enhance them normally leads to worse results. I think this might be because the data used is tabular and not very hard, so simpler models work on it better, while more complex models such as NN result in overfitting, specially with this data size, which is quite small. In this case, and comparing both models, I would definitely stick with the logit model.
